        <hr class="my-4">
        <h1 id="background">Background:</h1>
<p>Since its inception on August 3, 1954, the primary mandate of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has been the development and deployment of nuclear technology for energy and national security and the application of radiation technologies in the fields of agriculture, health care, industry, and basic research. While carrying out its mandate, DAE has simultaneously developed and mastered several complex technologies in radio astronomy, supercomputing, particle accelerators, plasma, and cryogenics. Developing these complex technologies has always resulted from the department’s high-standard basic and applied research.</p>

<p>As the country’s leading scientific department, DAE has substantially contributed to several national and international programs.
Considering the above development of the department over seven decades, DAE has sought an annual conclave to celebrate its scientific accomplishments and plan for the future. Thus, DAE has planned to host its inaugural Conclave at NISER Bhubaneswar from October 22-25, 2024, as a part of its Platinum Jubilee Celebration. This landmark event will provide a platform for experts and participants from all the DAE units and its aided institutions to showcase their scientific and technological accomplishments. The Conclave will serve as a focal point for discussions on the latest advancements in diverse applications of nuclear science and technology, encompassing critical areas such as energy security, healthcare, food security, water security, waste management, and cutting-edge technologies including unique and critical materials, advance computational technology including quantum Computing, 3D printing technology, mining and processing of atomic minerals and basic and applied research in connected areas. Notably, the participation of around 500 scientists, experts, and more than 50 exhibitors will enhance the experience by showcasing state-of-the-art equipment and services related to nuclear science and technology for societal benefits. 
Moreover, the conclave will contextualize these results against the backdrop of the global target for achieving net-zero carbon emissions and addressing the escalating India’s energy demand in the forthcoming years. In addition, the Conclave will also create platforms to provide solutions for Food Security and Health Care through Nuclear Energy for India’s 1.6 billion population by mid-century. In doing so, the Conclave will contribute to defining a path forward in the dynamic landscape of nuclear energy research and technology application.</p>
